### **Stage One Task - Python Solutions**  

This repository contains solutions for the Stage One Task, covering various biological and computational concepts. The implemented functions include:  

1. **DNA to Protein Translation** â€“ A function that converts a DNA sequence into its corresponding protein sequence using a codon table.  
2. **Logistic Population Growth Simulation** â€“ A function that models a logistic growth curve with customizable parameters for lag and exponential phases.  
3. **Generating Multiple Growth Curves** â€“ A function that creates 100 different growth curves and stores them in a Pandas DataFrame.  
4. **Time to 80% Carrying Capacity** â€“ A function that determines when a population reaches 80% of its maximum growth.  
5. **Hamming Distance Calculation** â€“ A function that computes the Hamming distance between two strings, such as Slack and Twitter usernames.  

These implementations demonstrate the use of Python for biological simulations, data analysis, and string comparison. ðŸš€
